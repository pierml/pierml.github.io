## 1.Activation of our free trial

When you create an alibaba cloud service account, you can test for free some of their various services.
I choose to test for 12 months of free trial the Burstable Type t5 little virtual machine.

When you create it, you can choose between 17 datacenters. Most of them are in APAC, but we have 2 datacenters in Europe and 2 in north America.
From Paris, I have to choose between Frankfurt or London. Because the brexit I choose Frankfurt.
In a second time, you have to choose you OS. I choose Aliyun Linux OS which is a fork of CentOS Linux made by Alibaba. Windows Core or Ubuntu is possible too.

## 2.The console

When you log to your console, the monthly cost is highlight. On the left a flux with the latest news from Alibaba.

The traduction in French is not very good and sometimes, because I manage a server in the Frankfort datacenter I have german or sometimes chinese, so I recommand to choose the English.
From here, we can create new services and I can say they have a very lot of choice. VM, IA, Big Data...

Let's check now my elastic vm. On the elastic compute page we have the list of our Instances from the Frankfurt datacenter. If you want to check another datacenter you have a menu to go.

I can click to my instance to manage my server. Change my root password is very easy from the interface and make a snapshot of my disk too.
All is configurable without the service support.

## 3. Test of Domain Names Service

Alibaba provides a registrar service from the console to manage our purchased domain name.

## 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, the chinese cloud is very complete with a lot a functionnality for professional. All of these are easily accessible and the servers are speed. The navigation is also clear but we have quickly too much tabs open. The traduction is not very good too, so you have to use the english. The price are competitive and are approximatively the same than AWS or Azure.
