## 1.Create a context to your Azure environment

You can execute directly on Azure your containers. The name of the service is Azure Container Instance and it have been created to execute short-lived containers. If you want to execute long-lived containers like an nginx or a database, the fare are very expensive (1â‚¬ by day by container) and I think it's better to use Azure Kubernetes Services or Cloud App service. 

On your local machine you have just to create a new context for your docker environment and connect it to your Azure account.

>Powershell
{:.filename}
{% highlight powershell %}
docker login azure
docker context create aci [my aci context] \
    --resource-group [your ressource group] \
    --location [your location]
docker context ls
docker context use [my aci context]
{% endhighlight %}

## 2.Start your containers with a Docker-Compose file

To start your containers the command is lightly different.
On your local environment you use the syntax "docker-compose up". For your Azure environment it's "docker compose up" 

>Powershell
{:.filename}
{% highlight powershell %}
docker compose up
docker ps
docker compose down
{% endhighlight %}

## 3.Delete your Azure context

You can delete your Azure context on your local machine with this command.

>Powershell
{:.filename}
{% highlight powershell %}
docker context rm [my aci context]
{% endhighlight %}
