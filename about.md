# Hi! I'm Pierre

![Pierre Mesnil]({{ 'assets/images/profil.jpg' | relative_url }}){: height: 100px }

>All along my career, I had a lot of position in IT domain. I start to work for an university as a system and network administrator. It's within this period that I was certified Cisco.
>Later, I pursued my career as a PHP developer for an e-commerce and after as .NET developer. I write a lot of software for private companies. I was briefly a project manager too.
>Since many year, I am specialized in data. I'm currently data engineer, I like this job because it's between IT administration and software's development. The domain of data is very wide with big data technologies (Hadoop, MongoDb, Spark...) and classic BI (SQL server, MySQL, PowerBI...)
>My interests span data science, software development, hacking, blockchain, new technologies and electronic music.
>I'm also fan of the Microsoft brand and I'm based in Paris area.
