>All along my career, I had a lot of position in IT domain. I start to work for an university as a system and network administrator. It's within this period that I was certified Cisco.

>Since many year, I am specialized in data. I'm currently data engineer, I like this job because it's between IT administration and software's development. The domain of data is very wide with big data technologies (Hadoop, MongoDb, Spark...) and classic BI (SQL server, MySQL, PowerBI...)
