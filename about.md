>Throughout my career, I had a lot of positions in the IT domain. I started working for a university as a system and network administrator. During this period of time, I became certified in Cisco technologies.
>Later, I pursued my career as a PHP developer for an e-commerce website and after as .NET developer. I wrote a lot of software for private companies.
>For many years, I'm specialized in data. I’m currently a BI/Big Data consultant. I like this job because it combines software development and IT administration. The domain of data is very wide with big data technologies (Hadoop, MongoDb, Spark…) and classic BI (SQL server, PowerBI…)
>My interests consists of data science, software development, new technologies and electronic music.
>I'm also based in the Paris area and I come from Normandy.
